# Human_Activity_Recognition
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a problem that is an active research field in pervasive computing. An HAR system has the main goal of analyzing human activities by observing and interpreting ongoing events.

Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data set (HAPT) data set is publicly available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions.

The data set contains data from tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope of a smart-phone, both captured at a frequency of 50 Hz. The data set consists of six basic activities (static and dynamic) and six postural transitions between the static activities. The static activities include standing, sitting and lying. The dynamic activities include walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs. stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand are the classes for postural transitions between the static activities
